I'm the creator and maintainer of White Tree Bible\u2014a project built (so far) from scratch by a single software engineering manager (and dad of four) living in Boise, Idaho.</p> <p>I grew up as an aviation missionary kid in Indonesia, attended school in Malaysia, and moved to the U.S. for college. My lifelong love for the Bible, combined with inspiration from the Bible Project (Tim Mackie), led me to pursue a master's degree in Biblical Exposition (hopefully graduating in Fall 2025).</p> <p>This site is a labor of love, built on nights and weekends, aiming to help others explore the rich connections between people, places, and themes in the Bible. I hope it inspires curiosity, deeper study, and a sense of wonder at the biblical story. May your life advance in every way as you delight in the instruction of Yahweh day and night!</p> <p>Thank you for visiting and being part of this journey!</p> <p>I appreciate you,</p> <p>Robert</p>"},{"location":"about/get-email-updates/","title":"Get Email Updates","text":""}]}
