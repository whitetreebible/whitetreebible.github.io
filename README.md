# WhiteTreeBible
Welcome to **WhiteTreeBible**! This is a collection of passion projects started by a software engineer who loves both coding and the Bible. The goal of these projects is to provide useful tools and resources for Bible study (as you would see from the index.md, but this is the dev view).

If you're interested in staying updated on the latest developments, please consider [signing up for email updates](./about/get-email-updates/).

If you want to contribute, each project has its own repository, and you'll need to read up on those.
