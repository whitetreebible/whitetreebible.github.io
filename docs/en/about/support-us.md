## Join Something Beautiful

WhiteTreeBible is born out of a deep love for the Word of God and a desire to create tools that help others delight in the instruction of Yahweh. This isn't just about building software—it's about loving Him with all of our emotion, intellect, and will, with all of our embodied existence, and with all the power, resources, and substance we bring to bear.

**This project will always be free. But with your help, it can grow faster and reach more people.**

## The Vision

We believe that technology can serve the ancient wisdom of Scripture in beautiful ways. Every connection discovered, every insight shared, every tool built is an act of worship—a way of exploring the infinite depths of God's Word with the minds and skills He has given us.

Your support doesn't just fund development; it participates in something eternal. You're helping create resources that could impact Bible study for generations to come.

## How Your Support Helps

While I don't need financial support to put food on the table, your partnership could help us:

- **Accelerate Development**: Dedicate more time to building and refining these tools
- **Expand the Team**: Bring on other passionate developers, designers, and Bible scholars
- **Improve Infrastructure**: Provide faster, more reliable hosting and services
- **Create More Resources**: Develop additional tools, content, and educational materials
- **Go Full-Time**: The dream of doing this work full-time would be incredible
- **Reach More People**: Translate tools, improve accessibility, and expand globally

## The Heart Behind This

This work flows from genuine delight in God's instruction. Every late night coding session, every database design decision, every user interface choice is motivated by love for Yahwah and His kingdom. 

We're not trying to get rich—we're trying to build something that honors Yahwah and serves His church. If your heart resonates with that vision, we'd be honored to have you as a partner in this work.
