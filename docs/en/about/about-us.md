# About Us

## Our Mission

We exist to create beautiful, thoughtful tools that help people explore the rich depths of Scripture. Our vision is to build technology that serves the ancient wisdom of God's Word, helping believers discover connections, deepen their understanding, and delight in the instruction of Yahweh.

## Our Story

WhiteTreeBible began as a passion project—born from the intersection of software engineering expertise and a lifelong love for the Bible. What started as late-night coding sessions has grown into a vision for comprehensive Bible study tools that honor both the technical craft and the sacred text.

We believe that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can illuminate the intricate connections woven throughout Scripture, making the riches of God's Word more accessible to seekers, students, and scholars alike.

## Our Team

### Robert Whiting - Founder & Lead Developer

I'm the creator and current maintainer of WhiteTreeBible—a software engineering manager (and dad of four) living in Boise, Idaho.

My journey began as an aviation missionary kid in Indonesia, attending school in Malaysia, before moving to the U.S. for college. This multicultural background shaped my perspective on how technology can bridge cultures and languages in service of the Gospel.

My lifelong love for the Bible, combined with inspiration from teachers like Tim Mackie (The Bible Project), led me to pursue a master's degree in Biblical Exposition (Fall 2025). This formal training complements years of personal study and a deep desire to help others encounter the delightful, transformative, and deeply connected nature of Scripture.

Currently, this site is built on nights and weekends—a true labor of love. But the vision is much bigger than what one person can accomplish alone.

## Our Vision for Growth

We dream of a future where WhiteTreeBible becomes a comprehensive suite of interconnected tools, developed by a passionate team of:

- **Developers** who understand both code and Scripture
- **Biblical scholars** who can ensure theological accuracy and depth  
- **Designers** who can make complex connections beautiful and intuitive
- **Content creators** who can bridge academic insights with practical application
- **Community managers** who can foster meaningful discussions and feedback

## Join Our Journey

Whether you're a user discovering connections in Scripture, a developer interested in contributing code, a scholar with theological insights, or a supporter helping fund the vision—you're part of our story.

We're still small, still growing, still learning. But we believe God can use humble beginnings to accomplish something beautiful for His kingdom.

May your life advance in every way as you delight in the instruction of Yahweh day and night![^ps1]
