Welcome to **WhiteTreeBible**! This is a collection of passion projects started by a software engineer who loves both coding and the Bible. The goal of these projects is to provide useful tools and resources for Bible study.

## Projects

### [Connections](https://connections.whitetreebible.com)
A web application that helps users explore connections between different Bible characters, places, and themes. Follow connected stories and see how they interrelate.

This project is in early development. [Stay tuned for updates](../about/get-email-updates/)!

### [Blog](https://blog.whitetreebible.com)
A blog where I share insights, reflections, and technical details about the projects. It also includes articles on Bible study techniques and software development.

(coming soon)

### [Hebrew Flashcards](https://hebrewflashcards.whitetreebible.com)
A web app to help users learn and memorize Hebrew vocabulary through flashcards and daily reading.

Doesn't exist, yet, but it'd be cool to build.
